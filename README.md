# Algorithms and Data Structures database

A database of algorithms and data structures I have written/saved.

## Implementation

### C++ 
Cpp stuff was made to be as generic as possible with the help of metaprogamming. Most of the algorithms and datastructures reside in `include` directory inside `.hpp` files.

### Python
Mostly single file.
